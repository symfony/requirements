You did not renamed the file which is still named `check.php`, right?

Correct. Having `check.php` by default is fine.

But consider doing

```
mv public/index.php public/index.php.orig && \
mv public/check.php public/index.php
```

so we can quickly leverage the current NGINX configuration and verify the web-checks. At this point the HTML link still points to `/check.php` which will be 404.

Once good we revert `mv public/index.php.orig public/index.php`

Alternatively we can remove the link in favor of a refresh (F5) :man_shrugging:

Refresh sounds better to me.

Agree.. that allows us to opt-out from any logic :)

Now done.
